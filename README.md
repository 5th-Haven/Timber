# Timber
Are you tired of having to break down an entire tree manually? This plugin is designed to help you with this. With it you can harvest an entire tree by just breaking its bottom part!

Notable information:

A tree is only chopped if you use an axe.
If you are in survival the axe you are using will be damaged for each block it breaks in the tree.
You can disallow players/ranks from using this feature by giving them the permission “timber.disallow”.
